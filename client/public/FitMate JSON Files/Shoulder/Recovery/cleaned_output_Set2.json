Each head has similar functions, but they do have some variance."

The insertion is at the linea alba, pubic crest, and the lower 3-4 ribs.\r\n\r\nThe internal oblique serves the exact same functions as the external oblique - aiding rotation, flexion and lateral flexion of the spine.\r\n\r\nThe external oblique is visible at low body fat percentages. The muscle appears as a series of diagonal lines connecting to the six-pack.\r\n\r\nThe external oblique originates from the 5th \u2013 8th ribs, and insert at several points (linea alba, iliac spine, pubic crest, and the iliac crest).\r\n\r\nThe functions of the external oblique are to aid in rotation (chopping down a tree), flexion (bending over), and lateral flexion of the spine (bending to the side)."
