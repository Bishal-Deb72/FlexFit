However, the spinal erectors travel the length of the entire spine. The upper fibers tuck under the latissimus dorsi and trapezius, and therefore are not visible to the naked eye."

                "description": "The hamstrings are the big muscles on the back of your thighs. Together with the quadriceps, the hamstrings make walking and standing possible.\r\n\r\nThe hamstrings are made up of the following muscles - the biceps femoris (short and long head), the semimembranosus, and the semitendinosus.\r\n\r\nThe hamstrings are a weak muscle when compared with the quadriceps (front thigh muscle). Both the hamstrings and the quadriceps pull on the knee joint, so if one of those muscles is stronger than the other, then knee problems are bound to arise. A good rule of thumb is to make sure that the hamstrings are 2/3 as strong as the quadriceps. For example, if you can resist 100 lbs with your quads, then you should be able to resist 66 lbs with your hamstrings."

                "description": "The obliques are made up of the internal and external obliques. \r\n\r\nThe internal oblique sits between the transverse abdominis and the external oblique. The origin is from the iliac crest, and the lower part of the pelvis. The insertion is at the linea alba, pubic crest, and the lower 3-4 ribs.\r\n\r\nThe internal oblique serves the exact same functions as the external oblique - aiding rotation, flexion and lateral flexion of the spine.\r\n\r\nThe external oblique is visible at low body fat percentages. The muscle appears as a series of diagonal lines connecting to the six-pack.\r\n\r\nThe external oblique originates from the 5th \u2013 8th ribs, and insert at several points (linea alba, iliac spine, pubic crest, and the iliac crest).\r\n\r\nThe functions of the external oblique are to aid in rotation (chopping down a tree), flexion (bending over), and lateral flexion of the spine (bending to the side)."
