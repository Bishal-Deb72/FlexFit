Well-developed shoulders can give the appearance of a smaller waist (because the shoulders look broader). Therefore, well-trained delts improve the look of the entire physique.\r\n\r\nThe deltoid has three different heads: anterior (front), lateral (middle), and posterior (rear). Each head has similar functions, but they do have some variance."
